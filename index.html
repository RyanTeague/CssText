   <!--CSS Text

    CSS has a lot of properties for formatting text.
--> 

<div>
    <h1>text formatting</h1>
    <p>This text is styled with some of the text formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform, and color properties.
    The paragraph is indented, aligned, and the space between characters is specified. The underline is removed from this colored
    <a target="_blank" href="tryit.asp?filename=trycss_text">"Try it Yourself"</a> link.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<!--Text Color

    The color property is used to set the color of the text. The color is
    specified by:

    . a color name - like "red"
    . a HEX value - like "#ff0000"
    . An RGB value - like "rgb(255, 0, 0)"

    The defult text color for a page  is defined in the body selector.
-->

<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is an ordinary paragraph. Notice that this text is blue. The default text color for a page is defined in the body selector.</p>
<p>Another paragraph.</p>

<hr>

<!--Text Color and Background Color

    In this example, we define both the background-color property and the 
    color property:

-->

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This page has a grey background color and a blue text.</p>
<div>This is a div.</div>

<!--Important: High contrast is very important for people with vision problems.
    So, always ensure that the contrast between the text color and the
    background color (or background image) is good !

    The CSS Text COlor Property

    color       Specifies the color of text
